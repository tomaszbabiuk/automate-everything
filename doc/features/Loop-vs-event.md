# Loop-based automation vs Event-based automation
### Example 1 - A wall switch
Let's imagine that your goal is to turn the light off every day at 23:00 to save power. You could do this in a loop by checking if the light is on every minute and turning it off if the time is greater than 23:00. In normal situation that's fine, but when you'll decide to turn the light manually by the switch it can compete with the automation.
