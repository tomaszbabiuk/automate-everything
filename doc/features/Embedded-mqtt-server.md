# Embedded MQTT Broker
There's no need to install MQTT Broker separately. The Automate Everything contains the instance of [Moquette](https://moquette-io.github.io/moquette/).

The MQTT service can be reused across all plugins.

If you're a user... there's nothing you need to do to use devices that utilized MQTT a lot.
If you're a developer, read [here](/doc/dev/MQTT-broker.md) how to access MQTT in your plugins.
