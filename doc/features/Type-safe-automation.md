# Type-safe automation

One of the best features of Automate Everything is type-safe automation that works on two levels:
1. The Object level
2. The Automation Blocks level

As mentioned in the [introduction](/doc/features/OS-for-automation-projects.md), the objects are used to model physical devices.

The Object level automation is created entirely in the code by the Developers. That code is necessary for the object to work properly.
