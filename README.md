With correct set of plugins you can automate literally everything!

# A note of history
The work on "Automate Everything" was started in 2012. Yes... almost 10 years ago!. At first the project was called "geekHOME Server". In the beginning geekHOME was written in C# Micro Framework (running on FEZ Cobra!). It's been a dark times for DIY Home Automation: open source projects like OpenHAB was barely starting. Some other projects (that are now open-sourced) were paid, so I decided to create something on my own.
In 2015 the code was ported to Java and run on Raspberry Pi 1. It was able to control the lights, central heating, alarm and ventilation at my own house. It has never been published.

In 2020, I decided to give the project another shot. "Automate Everything" is now a full-blown automation server. Everything has been rewritten (only the original concept hasn't changed).
I didn't focus on Home Automation this time... I wanted to create an "Operating System" for every type of automation project. I wanted to create something that will be really easy to extend by the others. That's why every single aspect of "Automate Everything" can be controlled or extended by plugins everybody can write. I hope the project will be useful for the other "DIY Tinkerers" like me.
